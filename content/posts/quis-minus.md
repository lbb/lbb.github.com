Hello Reader, this shall be the introduction to my blog.

As with every Software Engineer at some point in his life, I’d like to share my
experience working in academia and the industry. I hope that someone will read
this and learn from my failures and success.

## Maybe some content

As you might have noticed this blog looks unusual. It does not have lots of
styling nor colors. I’m a big fan of plain-no-CSS websites. These websites work
well on phones, despite their appearance. Let’s be honest here most sites look
fancy at first, but it’s complicated to read longer texts on them. I’d like to
have an elegant theme, but I think that this will destroy the reader experience
in the long run. I love the Swiss or International font Style from the 1920’s.
To give it a modern touch I’ll use this style for headers. I want the
readability of TeX documents, which I miss on many Websites.  Thus I’ve chosen a
Serif font for the text corpus. Serifs are easy to read, and we have reached a
point where displays have enough DPI to make serifs useful in the web. I’m
currently thinking of creating a dark theme optimized for the rising fleet of
OLED devices.

## Me

At the point of writing, I have just finished my internship at Google, and I’m
currently unemployed. I’m going back to Berlin to complete my B.Sc in CS at the
TUB.

I started working at Loodse 2 years ago where I helped to build kubermatic.io a
Kubernetes scheduler that runs on Kubernetes. It is an enterprise-targeted
product that can spin up hundreds of Kubernetes clusters. We used the underlying
Kubernetes cluster as a layer of abstraction.

After Loodse I got an internship at Google in Seattle. For my project, I created
krew, a kubectl plugin manager. Krew is its own project, and I’ll cover it in a
separate post (I finally have a place to do this!).

My first development setup in highschool was a Gentoo machine (Someone trolled
me hard). It took me 3 weeks to set it up. Oh boy, don’t get me started on
Xconfig’s. Apparently, I also had an Optimus laptop, which made things a lot
harder.

As a quick fix, I used no X server and purely used the TTY with xterm (Awesome
times, I only used 40mb of my 8gb RAM!).

Around that time I also joined the CCC to learn more about the tech culture! I’m
still a member, and you can find me at several CCC related events!

After I had enough of waiting 3 hours every week to compile updates I switched
to Arch. After I also had enough of maintaining an Arch distro, I realized that
I just want to work productively. Having a highly customized system is super fun
but at the same time not really convenient in the longer run (This is a very
personal opinion). Instead of having to deal with ppa’s I switched to a system
that has homebrew, which I really love because of its convenient UX, AUR like
community and similarities to Gentoo’s emerge.

I hope I entertained you for a minute, see you next time!

## TL;DR

* I’ll always write TL;DR’s so you don’t have to read that damn long thing
* I’ll write a post on my Google intern project “krew”
